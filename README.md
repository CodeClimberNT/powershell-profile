Rember to read what you are installing in your system! What could work for me may break other system if you don't know what you're doing!

# Module used
  - Terminal-Icons
  - zoxide (need fzf installed for advanced features)
  - Chocolatey
  - oh-my-posh / starship (default)

# Installation of Modules
All the modules except `startship` should download automatically if not installed and if a connection to the internet is detected

To download `startship` follow the [Official Documentation](https://starship.rs/installing), tipically the download should be done with a simple command in the terminal
